We need to find a way to extract all the important parts of large texts like books or very big documents, and create a summary from them.\n\nSome simple ways to avoid using all the chunks for summarization is either randomly selecting chunks, or spacing out which chunks are selected. But what if we miss out on an important part of the text while doing this?\n\nA solution is K-means clustering, where each chunk is embedded, and then clusters are formed based on semantic meaning of those chunks. Then a summary is formed from each cluster, hopefully netting us a more accurate summary of huge texts.\n\nAnother advantage is the amount of requests sent to the API. While Map Reduction sends many requests, clustering will send only one request, saving a lot of money.\n\n### Loading our documents\nLet's implement this method to summarize many documents or whole books!\n\nFirst, we need to import some packages and load in our OpenAI API key, since we will be using OpenAI's GPT models.\n\n::: {#4e66fb23 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom utils import read_files, split_document_by_tokens\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport os\n\nload_dotenv()\nOPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, we will load in our documents.

If we were to use map reduction, sending all these tokens to the LLM would be pretty expensive. If we were using document stuffing, we might not be able to fit the document(s) at all!\n\n### Chunking our documents\n\nTo better facilitate clustering, let's split our documents into more manageable sizes, called chunks. There are many different ways to chunk a document, the easiest being to split on specific characters, like punctuation marks. Another method is to chunk on token count, this can be nice because you know how many tokens you're sending to the LLM with each chunk.\n\nLet's try with token chunking.\n\n::: {#dadc2ed9 .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"false\"}\nsplit_tender_competition = split_document_by_tokens(anbudskonkurranse, chunk_size=2000, overlap=200)\n\nsplit_book = split_document_by_tokens([pride_and_prejudice], chunk_size=2000, overlap=200)\n\nprint(f\"Now our tender competition is split up into {len(split_tender_competition)} documents\")\n\nprint(f\"And our book is split up into {len(split_book)} documents\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nNow our tender competition is split up into 98 documents\nAnd our book is split up into 92 documents\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Embedding\n\nClustering relies on embeddings to work. Embeddings are vector representations of text, so that LLMs can work with them (LLMs don't understand human readable text, they understand numbers). Similar pieces of text will be closer together in the vector space, therefore the hope is that we can \"cluster\" pieces of text with similar meaning together, because they are closer together in the vector space.\n\n::: {#ac2dfbb6 .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\n\nembeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY, model=\"text-embedding-3-small\")\n\ntender_vectors = embeddings.embed_documents([doc.page_content for doc in split_tender_competition])\n\nbook_vectors = embeddings.embed_documents([doc.page_content for doc in split_book])\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {#8b5290ec .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\nfrom sklearn.manifold import TSNE\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef plot_clusters(vectors, title, algo = None, ):\n    tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, random_state=42)\n    vectors = np.array(vectors)\n    reduced_data_tsne = tsne.fit_transform(vectors)\n    if algo:\n        plt.scatter(reduced_data_tsne[:, 0], reduced_data_tsne[:, 1], c=algo.labels_)\n    else:\n        plt.scatter(reduced_data_tsne[:, 0], reduced_data_tsne[:, 1])\n    plt.xlabel('Dimension 1')\n    plt.ylabel('Dimension 2')\n    plt.title(f'Cluster visualization for {title}.')\n    plt.show()\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's try to visualize how our chunks look in the vector space. Please note that the embedding vectors have 1536 dimensions, and here we have squished them down to two dimension, so a lot of information will be lost. Perhaps some clustering of chunks would be easier to see with more dimensions.\n\n::: {#e22d68b4 .cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nplot_clusters(vectors=book_vectors, title=\"Pride and Prejudice\")\nplot_clusters(vectors=tender_vectors, title=\"the tender competition\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](clustering_files/figure-html/cell-8-output-1.png){width=587 height=449}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](clustering_files/figure-html/cell-8-output-2.png){width=587 height=449}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Clustering\n\nK-means clustering is an algorithm which starts by randomly initializing the centroids of a given amount of clusters (k). A centroid is one datapoint in the center of a cluster. It then iterates through two main steps: assignment and update. \n\nIn the assignment step, each data point is assigned to the closest centroid based on a distance metric, typically Euclidean distance. In the update step, the centroids are recalculated as the mean of all data points assigned to each cluster. \n\nThis process repeats until the centroids no longer move significantly, indicating convergence. The result is a grouping of data points such that points in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters, based on the chosen distance metric.\n\nNote that K-means takes the amount of clusters as a parameter. For now, we'll set it manually.\n\n::: {#f65e098e .cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n\nnum_clusters = 11\n\ntender_kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=num_clusters, random_state=42).fit(tender_vectors)\n\nbook_kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=num_clusters, random_state=42).fit(book_vectors)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow let's visualize our clusters:\n\n::: {#a9e1a334 .cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\nplot_clusters(vectors=tender_vectors, algo=tender_kmeans, title=\"the tender competition with 11 clusters\")\nplot_clusters(vectors=book_vectors, algo=book_kmeans, title=\"Pride and Prejudice with 11 clusters\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](clustering_files/figure-html/cell-10-output-1.png){width=587 height=449}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](clustering_files/figure-html/cell-10-output-2.png){width=587 height=449}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis looks alright, especially the tender competition has some clear clusters. However, how can we know that we have chosen the correct amount of clusters for our K-means algorithm?\n\n### Silhouette scoring\n\nSilhouette scoring is a method used to assess the quality of clusters when using for example K-means. The silhouette score for each data point is calculated based on two factors: \n- The average distance between the data point and all other points in the same cluster (cohesion)\n- The average distance between the data point and all points in the nearest cluster to which the data point does not belong (separation). \n\nWe find the silhouette score for one data point by taking the difference between these two distances, normalized by the maximum of the two. This score ranges from -1 to 1, where a score close to 1 indicates that the data point clearly belongs to its own cluster, a score near 0 indicates that the point is on the border of two clusters, and a score near -1 suggests that the point may have been assigned to the wrong cluster. The overall silhouette score of the clustering is the average of the silhouette scores of all the data points.\n\nSo what we can do is try many different values of k and find the silhouette score for each one, then choose the best scoring k as our cluster amount, where the score closest to 1 is best.\n\n::: {#35768891 .cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score\n\ndef find_optimal_clusters(vectors, max_k):\n    score = -1\n    best_n_clusters = 0\n    for k in range(3, max_k):\n        kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=1).fit_predict(vectors)\n        new_score = silhouette_score(vectors, kmeans)\n        if new_score > score:\n            best_n_clusters = k\n            score = new_score\n        print(f\"For n_clusters = {k}, silhouette score is {new_score})\")\n    print(f\"Best number of clusters is {best_n_clusters}\")\n    return best_n_clusters\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's find the optimal number of cluster for our tender competition:\n\n::: {#3aae19dc .cell execution_count=11}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntender_num_clusters = find_optimal_clusters(tender_vectors, max_k=20)\ntender_kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=tender_num_clusters, random_state=1).fit(tender_vectors)\nplot_clusters(vectors=tender_vectors, algo=tender_kmeans, title=f\"our tender competition with {tender_num_clusters} clusters\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nFor n_clusters = 3, silhouette score is 0.16319734949495834)\nFor n_clusters = 4, silhouette score is 0.13677655311745174)\nFor n_clusters = 5, silhouette score is 0.13867432915900288)\nFor n_clusters = 6, silhouette score is 0.11354961404064279)\nFor n_clusters = 7, silhouette score is 0.10669988485818448)\nFor n_clusters = 8, silhouette score is 0.10039881578450706)\nFor n_clusters = 9, silhouette score is 0.0775684824083643)\nFor n_clusters = 10, silhouette score is 0.07354397576934713)\nFor n_clusters = 11, silhouette score is 0.0896860457734401)\nFor n_clusters = 12, silhouette score is 0.09227585159583783)\nFor n_clusters = 13, silhouette score is 0.09388758282715984)\nFor n_clusters = 14, silhouette score is 0.09267778721302193)\nFor n_clusters = 15, silhouette score is 0.09460706544627888)\nFor n_clusters = 16, silhouette score is 0.0869772390044283)\nFor n_clusters = 17, silhouette score is 0.09299719039273895)\nFor n_clusters = 18, silhouette score is 0.10369596708641589)\nFor n_clusters = 19, silhouette score is 0.10545737216311063)\nBest number of clusters is 3\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](clustering_files/figure-html/cell-12-output-2.png){width=587 height=449}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd then for our book:\n\n::: {#7cc93c4f .cell execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\nbook_num_clusters = find_optimal_clusters(book_vectors, max_k=20)\nbook_kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=book_num_clusters, random_state=1).fit(book_vectors)\nplot_clusters(vectors=book_vectors, algo=book_kmeans, title=f\"Pride and Prejudice with {book_num_clusters} clusters\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nFor n_clusters = 3, silhouette score is 0.047733092427202854)\nFor n_clusters = 4, silhouette score is 0.051067859191365084)\nFor n_clusters = 5, silhouette score is 0.05523242135225988)\nFor n_clusters = 6, silhouette score is 0.0465462151274959)\nFor n_clusters = 7, silhouette score is 0.030455545138270337)\nFor n_clusters = 8, silhouette score is 0.03968968584609667)\nFor n_clusters = 9, silhouette score is 0.03900376290198097)\nFor n_clusters = 10, silhouette score is 0.0393203646925307)\nFor n_clusters = 11, silhouette score is 0.041871536535647465)\nFor n_clusters = 12, silhouette score is 0.04602273803755732)\nFor n_clusters = 13, silhouette score is 0.04664794070136)\nFor n_clusters = 14, silhouette score is 0.04450307354685479)\nFor n_clusters = 15, silhouette score is 0.037468937738576666)\nFor n_clusters = 16, silhouette score is 0.036899065375207624)\nFor n_clusters = 17, silhouette score is 0.04084609100393472)\nFor n_clusters = 18, silhouette score is 0.04017819773375103)\nFor n_clusters = 19, silhouette score is 0.039037963267425264)\nBest number of clusters is 5\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](clustering_files/figure-html/cell-13-output-2.png){width=587 height=449}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Summarization using K-means\n\nNow for the final piece of the puzzle.
